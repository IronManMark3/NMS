          Nischay, a school for underprivileged girls, was started as a community outreach programme by Neerja Modi School (Shri Modi Shikshan Sansthan) on 15th October, 2004 to provide free education to underprivileged girls. It aims to provide these girls quality education, alongside life and vocational skills, as a means of economic and social empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The school has been provided accommodation within the Neerja Modi school campus in Jaipur. At present, Nischay has a strength of 500 students who are given free education and a nutritious mid-day meal. The school started an extension of Nischay at Chachiawas, about 130 kms from the Jaipur. The Nischay School at Chachiawas houses 150 girls with the same facilities and resources.

          Community Service at NMS</h3>
        <div className="space-y-4">
  <p>
    Engagement in the community is pivotal to student life at NMS. The Community Service Programme aims to promote sensitivity in students as they deal with real world problems and seek solutions through critical thinking and action. It fosters skills and social responsibility to prepare them for leadership roles.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="space-y-4">
  <p>
    <strong>The Community Service Programme at NMS encompasses:<br />'Kaagaz'</strong> was started by Anant Patni and Faiz Khan, both of whom were high school students at NMS. One day, while reviewing the statistics of paper usage versus paper recycling, they discovered that the amount of paper used was nearly three times greater than the amount recycled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Motivated by this gap, they launched Kaagaz—an organization aimed at aiding those in need by recycling paper. Students collect waste paper from their school and surrounding offices and send it to recyclers. In return, they receive funds, which are then used to buy notebooks, pencils, and other essential school materials for underprivileged children.
  </p>
  <p>
    The students, with guidance from teachers, personally visit government schools to distribute the supplies and 
    engage with the students—emphasizing the value of education and encouraging active learning. Kaagaz not only drives 
    environmental awareness but also instills a deep sense of social responsibility and compassion in NMS students.

    <strong>'People With Paintbrushes'</strong> is a student-led initiative at NMS focused on transforming under-resourced spaces into inspiring environments through art. Students paint murals on the walls of government schools and low-income neighborhoods to make these areas more vibrant and educational.
  </p>
  <p>
    These murals often include colorful alphabets, math tables, inspirational quotes, and cultural motifs—turning bare walls into engaging learning tools. The project not only brightens communities but also nurtures creativity, teamwork, and pride in giving back.

    <strong>'ALMS'</strong> is a heartfelt student initiative that began in 2015 with the purpose of aiding those less fortunate. The program revolves around collecting and distributing daily necessities such as clothes, blankets, food, footwear, and toiletries to slum communities and the homeless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Students from different grades collaborate with teachers and parents to organize donation drives and carefully sort and package the collected items. Regular distribution camps are held where the student volunteers personally hand out the essentials and interact with recipients—learning gratitude, humility, and compassion through action.
  </p>
  <p>
    What started as a small gesture of kindness has evolved into a structured community effort embraced by the entire NMS family.

    <strong>"HUGS – Help Us Gift Smiles"</strong> is a beautiful project driven by students who collect old and discarded books, toys, and learning material. These items are sorted, refurbished, and thoughtfully packed to be gifted to children in orphanages, shelters, and community centers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond donation, the students also help build small libraries and reading corners using collected books. They engage with recipient children through storytelling and fun activities, making every visit joyful and meaningful. HUGS teaches empathy in action, reminding students that even the smallest gestures can bring great joy.

    Laughter so infectious,<br />

    When you have a lot of books and you don't know what to do with them, you come to H.U.G.S. A startup initiated by 3 girls in the 11th grade, H.U.G.S (Help Us Gift Smiles) is a book sharing platform. People who have umpteen books and issues storing them give their books to H.U.G.S. in return for exciting subscription offers and coupons from lifestyle stores and salons.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a lot of schools in Jaipur but most of them don't have libraries. Also, the upcoming cafes with the perfect ambience serve steaming latte but readers don’t enjoy them because these cafes don't have books to offer. We solve such problems by placing books in cafes and schools for free. Hence we utilize spare capacities and increase the cafes’ footfall!
  </p>
  <p>
    Buying second hand books from H.U.G.S. is a no brainer. Choose from our wide collection available on our online portal and place your order. We will deliver it at your doorstep. We also spread education by conducting course book sales for the needy at minimal prices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have already earned a profit of Rs. 45,000 and sold books to over 600 people through 2 major exhibitions – ADAA and FORHEX. We are in the top 4 teams that took part in TIE young entrepreneur’s competition.
