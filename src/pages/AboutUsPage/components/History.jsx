          The journey of our school began in the year 2001 and has achieved an unsurpassed growth over the last 2 decades. It makes us both proud and humbled to witness the school rising to be the No.1 educational institute in Jaipur – Rajasthan and No. 8 in India’s Day and Boarding School, by the Education World School Rankings 2020.

          We are a co-educational day/boarding school from kindergarten to grade 12. A majority of our students join us at age three and graduate with us as high school seniors. Our students cherish friendships and a life-time bond with their peers and the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also pride ourselves in being an academically competitive school, while we provide an ample extra-curricular and co-curricular opportunities as well. Our students participate and excel in competitive sports and athletics, academic Olympiads, science research programs, national chess championship, extensive debates, and start-up competitions. Sports, visual and performing arts, as well as yoga are an integral part of every student’s life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We uphold a robust leadership structure within our student community. The self-less conviction to give back and make a meaningful impact on the wider community is part of our student body’s DNA. They diligently engage deeply with campus community service initiatives and also reach out to a number of local NGOs, healthcare centers and government schools.
